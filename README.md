## Description

Refactoring existing code for Horiseon Social Solution Services to increase web accessibility for those with disabilities. Accessibility criteria as documented below have been met, along with additional improvements to the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments within the code.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
